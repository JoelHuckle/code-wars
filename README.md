# Code Wars
Every day I do a code wars challenge to keep my JavaScript sharp and post it here.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** JavaScript
After submitting a successful code wars challenge, I copy it to a JS file and push it to this repo. I have organised each challenge by kyu in their respective folders.

## Optimizations
I often go back to files to optimise their speed, readability or level of DRYness.
